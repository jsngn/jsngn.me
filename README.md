# jsngn.me

I made [this website](jsngn.me/) as a way to increase my online presence and to re-introduce myself to web dev.

## Directories and Files

[files](https://github.com/jsngn/jsngn.me/tree/gh-pages/files) contains images I used on the website.

.ico and .png files in the main directory are for the logo on different devices; manifest.json is also for the logo.

Other files are for the website's content and design.
