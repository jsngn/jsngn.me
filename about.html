			<p class="bodytxt">I have a wide range of interests when it comes to tech, from machine learning to gameplay programming â€” I simply love solving problems!</p>
			<p class="bodytxt">On campus, I am a Research Assistant, responsible for preparing clean data sets and visualizing data, in the Linguistics Program. I am also a Teaching Assistant for "CS50: Software Design and Implementation", and I have experience tutoring Computer Science with Dartmouth's Tutor Clearinghouse.</p>
			<p class="bodytxt">In my own time, I work on my personal projects (check out my GitHub!). For example I have made <b><a href="https://github.com/jsngn/steam-machine-learning" target="_blank">a ML model using Steam data</a></b> and <b><a href="https://github.com/jsngn/sizzling-assassin"  target="_blank">an RPG third-person shooter game</a></b> where you play as a greasy bacon! I have also posted some coursework projects that I am proud of, like <b><a href="https://github.com/jsngn/nlp-hmm" target="_blank">this part-of-speech tagger</a></b>, which is a natural language processor.</p>
			<p class="bodytxt">When I'm off the clock, I'm probably trying new food, exploring cities, watching Broadway musicals, or playing video games!</p>
